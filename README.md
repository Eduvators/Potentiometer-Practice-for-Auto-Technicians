# Potentiometers in Automotive Systems

This project is an **interactive HTML lesson** designed for educators and students to explore how potentiometers are used in various automotive sensor applications. It is especially suited for hosting in learning management systems like Canvas or on a standalone educational website.

## 📂 Contents
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing:
  - Educational content
  - Embedded Base64 potentiometer diagram
  - Interactive slider for signal voltage simulation

## 🚗 Learning Topics Covered
- Basic potentiometer operation with analog voltage outputs
- Applications in automotive systems, including:
  - Throttle Position Sensors (TPS)
  - Accelerator Pedal Position Sensors (APPS)
  - Steering Angle Sensors
  - Suspension Height Sensors
  - Dimmer Switches
  - Audio and Climate Controls

## 🧠 Interactive Feature
An HTML slider simulates a potentiometer wiper, dynamically updating the signal voltage based on user input (assuming a 5V reference).
